## Requirements

- PHP 7.4 or higher
- MB_String extension
- Depending on usage: 
  - OpenSSL extesion
  - Sodium extension


## Installation

```
composer require initphp/encryption
```

## Configuration

```php 
$options = [
    'algo'      => 'SHA256',
    'cipher'    => 'AES-256-CTR',
    'key'       => null,
    'blocksize' => 16,
];
```

- `algo` : Used by OpenSSL handler only. The algorithm to use to sign the data.
- `cipher` : Used by OpenSSL handler only. The encryption algorithm that will be used to encrypt the data.
- `key` : The top secret key string to use for encryption.
- `blocksize` : It is used for sodium handler only. It is used in the `sodium_pad()` and `sodium_unpad()` functions.


## Usage

```php 
require_once "vendor/autoload.php";
use \InitPHP\Encryption\Encrypt;

// OpenSSL Handler
/** @var $openssl \InitPHP\Encryption\HandlerInterface */
$openssl = Encrypt::use(\InitPHP\Encryption\OpenSSL::class, [
    'algo'      => 'SHA256',
    'cipher'    => 'AES-256-CTR',
    'key'       => 'TOP_Secret_Key',
]);

// Sodium Handler
/** @var $sodium \InitPHP\Encryption\HandlerInterface */
$sodium = Encrypt::use(\InitPHP\Encryption\Sodium::class, [
    'key'       => 'TOP_Secret_Key',
    'blocksize' => 16,
]);
```

### Methods

#### `encrypt()`

```php 
public function encrypt(mixed $data, array $options = []): string;
```

#### `decrypt()`

```php 
public function decrypt(string $data, array $options = []): mixed;
```

## Writing Your Own Handler

```php 
namespace App;

use \InitPHP\Encryption\{HandlerInterface, BaseHandler};

class MyHandler extends BaseHandler implements HandlerInterface
{
    public function encrypt($data, array $options = []): string
    {
        $options = $this->options($options);
        // ... process
    }

    public function decrypt($data, array $options = [])
    {
        $options = $this->options($options);
        // ... process
    }
}
```

```php 
use \InitPHP\Encryption\Encrypt;

$myhandler = Encrypt::use(\App\MyHandler::class);
```
